This repo contains the codes for the paper: [W-NetPan: Double-U Network for Inter-sensor Self-supervised Pan-sharpening](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231223001339). The increasing availability of remote sensing data allows dealing with spatial-spectral limitations by means of pan-sharpening methods. However, fusing inter-sensor data poses important challenges, in terms of resolution differences, sensor-dependent deformations and ground-truth data availability, that demand more accurate pan-sharpening solutions. In response, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based pan-sharpening model which is termed as the double-U network for self-supervised pan-sharpening (W-NetPan). In more details, the proposed architecture adopts an innovative W-shape that integrates two U-Net segments which sequentially work for spatially matching and fusing inter-sensor multi-modal data. In this way, a synergic effect is produced where the first segment resolves inter-sensor deviations while stimulating the second one to achieve a more accurate data fusion. Additionally, a joint loss formulation is proposed for effectively training the proposed model without external data supervision. The experimental comparison, conducted over four coupled Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 datasets, reveals the advantages of W-NetPan with respect to several of the most important state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods available in the literature.
